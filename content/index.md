# Introduction

Convox Praxis is a universal infrastructure interface. When you develop and deploy applications using Praxis you completely abstract away concerns about where your application is running. Whether itâ€™s running on your laptop or cloud infrastructure its configuration and your interactions with it will be the same. This allows you to focus exclusively on developing your application to solve your business challenges rather than thinking about low-level operations.

Praxis abstracts away the underlying infrastructure by providing a set of universal primitives and a standard API to interact with them. The Praxis primitives are the collection of things that you need to build and deploy any application.
